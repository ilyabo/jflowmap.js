**UPDATE:** Check out [flowmap.blue](https://flowmap.blue), our new flow map visualization tool.

Flow map visualization built in JavaScript with [D3][d3]. View in action [here][demo].


Check 
[flowmap.gl](https://github.com/teralytics/flowmap.gl), our new WebGL flowmap drawing library. 
There is also a [helper library for drawing SVG flow lines](https://github.com/ilyabo/svg-flowline) and an [older Java flow map drawing library](https://github.com/ilyabo/jflowmap/tree/master/JFlowMap).
